# Agile Methodology

This project follows the agile methodology that is developed iteratively and incrementally within the team. Although it is a small-scale project, it adheres to the four main phases of the software development proces, software requirement, design, implementation, and testing. The process is done so in an iterative and incremental manner so as to follow the Scrum process (which falls under the Agile umbrella). In the formation of our project our team of four first brainstormed for ideas, planned the outline and discussed technologies we wanted to incorporate in the project in the preliminary discussions. 
Jira and Confluence are used as part of our Scrum process. The project is developed in short sprints of one to two weeks throughout the timeline, with regular scrum meetings between members to discuss updates. Issues and epics are created in Jira to record the work process, and product backlog are created accordingly to keep track of what work still needs to be done. 

# On the Backend

## Java Springboot

We wanted to work with Spring Boot to utilize its production-grade features to create a full, stand-alone RESTful web application. We have chosen the MVC architecture as part of the framework to help handle HTTP requests and responses. 

## MySQL Database

The application uses Spring Data JPA for CRUD funcationalities in the database. 

## Unit Test

The project has unit tests in the developmental phase as part of the testing in the Scrum process. 

# On the Frontend

## Thymeleaf and React Hooks

Frontend UI is rendered with Thymeleaf and React Hooks 

## Bootstrap 

Bootstrap framework is used for frontend rendering
